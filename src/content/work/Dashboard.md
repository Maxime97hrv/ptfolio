    <b>Objective:</b> 
    In planning our trip to Los Angeles, we're motivated by a number of reasons that make this destination so attractive to us. Firstly, we're excited by the idea of exploring the heart of the global film industry. We aspire to visit iconic studios, attend film shoots and maybe even catch a glimpse of famous stars. What's more, we're fascinated by the prospect of exploring the natural parks such as Joshua Tree that surround the Los Angeles area. We're also looking forward to sampling culinary delights from different cultures around the world, and exploring the vibrant neighborhoods where we can feast on local specialties and exotic foods.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
    However, as conscious travelers, our concern for safety remains paramount. That's why I've sought to better understand the reality of crime in Los Angeles through this statistical study. By knowing the potentially riskier areas and the most common types of crime, we'll be better prepared to take precautionary measures and plan a safe and enjoyable trip to take full advantage of all Los Angeles has to offer.
